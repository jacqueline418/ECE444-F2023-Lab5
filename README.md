## Pros & Cons of TDD

**Pros:** 

TDD is a software development practice that focuses on creating test cases before developing the actual code. TDD encourages developers to write modular code toward a testable design. It also provides higher product quality in terms of better code and fewer defects because writing tests forces developers to think carefully and fully understand the requirements and expectations of the application when designing and writing code. TDD also prevents the writing of unnecessary code; the amount of code needed to make the test pass should be just enough.

**Cons:**

TDD is time-consuming and may reduce coding efficiency, especially with insufficient preparation or a lack of design requirements. Coming up with test cases can be quite challenging in such cases. Another aspect is that TDD can be hard to maintain. If the test suite is large, it would require ongoing effort to keep the extensive test suite organized and ensure it aligns with changing requirements. Regularly reviewing and refactoring tests to ensure correct behavior and efficient testing also demands effort.
